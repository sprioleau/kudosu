# Kudosu | An ad-free Sudoku game for enthusiasts.

This game was created after playing several games of Killer Sudoku during a flight.

Since my phone was in Airplane mode, I didn't see any ads and it was glorious! I so enjoyed playing with no ads that I decided to build my own version of the game.

This is that game.
